    <p>The Teachers' College High School opened its doors on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1907. It began as a way to help student teachers 
      have experience in the classroom with real high school students. Over the years of its existence, Teachers' College High had three names, starting with 
    Temple High, then transitioning to Teachers' College High, and ending with University High. The school closed its doors in 1970 as it morphed into Lincoln
      East High School, and most of the historical record was moved into the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Archives and Special Editions department.</p>
