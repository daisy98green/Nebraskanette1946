    <h2>Teachers' College High School <em>The Nebraskanette</em> Digital Edition</h2>
    <p class="byline">Edited by Jocelyn Clayton</p>
    <p>The Teachers' College High School opened its doors on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1908. It began as a way to help student teachers 
      have experience in the classroom with real high school students. Over the years of its existence, Teachers' College High had three names, starting with 
    Temple High, then transitioning to Teachers' College High, and ending with University High. The school closed its doors in 1967 as it morphed into Lincoln
      East High School, and most of the historical record was moved into the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Archives and Special Editions department.</p>
      <p>The 1946 <em>The Nebraskanette</em> digitized on this website is the second in a series of <em>The Nebraskanette</em> literary edition publications from
        the Teachers' College High School students. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln houses many of these editions, but does not have the first edication from 1945.
        This is why the 1946 (second) edition has been digitized instead of the 1945 (first) edition. These publications were entirely created and produced by the
        students of Teachers' College High School. As such, the pictures on the pages were likely hand-drawn by either the authors of the texts or by another student.
        It is because of these drawings that facsimiles are included next to the typed text to showcase this hand-drawn artwork. The pictures often relate to the 
        subject of the short story or essay, and they sometimes are based off a cartoon character.

   <p class="center">This project was an undertaking for ENGL 878 Digital Archives and Editions at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in Fall 2021. 
   The 1946 <em>The Nebraskanette</em> manuscript was obtained from the University's Archives and Special Editions department. This manuscript
     was digitized to allow the second in a series of <em>Nebraskanette Literary Editions</em> to be accessible to people outside of the Archives.</p>
