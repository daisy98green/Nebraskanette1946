         Last year a new idea was worked out 
         whereby the longer literary efforts of 
         the students could be published. The 
         result was a magazine edition of the 
         Nebraskanette and it proved successful 
         enough to be worth trying again. We 
         hope you enjoy it and that in future 
         years more and better magazines will be 
         printed.

      <h3>STAGEFRIGHT</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Barbara Fifer</p>
      
      
      <p>
         My first appearance in public was a trying or-deal. I was playing in a piano recital and there 
         were about fifty other students beside myself who 
         were also playing in the recital.  I was eleven 
         years old and thoroughly frightened.  I was to 
         play a waltz and a march and was about the fortieth 
         student to play in the program.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing the big audience made me shudder in my 
         tracks and I was in a terrible suspense waiting 
         for my turn to play.  When my turn finally came, I 
         slowly and quite unsteadily, to be sure, made my 
         way across the stage to the piano.  My teeth were 
         chattering and suddenly my fingers became very 
         stiff!  Everyone was watching me, so I tried to 
         begin to play.  Somehow I finished the waltz and 
         was waiting for the audience to become quiet in 
         order that I could finish and run off the stage 
         from all these frightening people.  I played 
         the march as if I were chasing a fire engine to a 
         fire, and almost fell, because I was in such a 
         hurry to leave the stage.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My next public appearance came when I learned 
         how to play the violin and joined the Irving Junior 
         High School orchestra.  I also played in the Lin-coln High School Summer "A" orchestra.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The most embarassing [embarrassing]
          situation arose while I 
         was playing in a concert at Northeast High School. 
         It happened just before curtain time.  I broke a 
         violin string and was unable to fix it myself. Our 
         conductor finally fixed it for me delaying the pro-gram about a half minute.
         </p>
      
      <a href="1946/1946_05.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_05.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My second piano recital was a little more like 
         recitals ought to be.  However, I was so scared my 
         hands became cold, and I could not move my fingers. 
         The agony and suspense of waiting for my turn to 
         play in the program was dreadful.  I was contin-uously trying to tell myself that I might profit 
         by listening to the others play.  The main diffi-culty was sitting still without making any noises
         and not being conspicuous.  I was supposed to be 
         enjoying the music!  My main accomplishment of 
         this recital was that there was a more distinct 
         difference between my march and other number.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Playing at home also presets its problems.  I 
         do not know of anyone who likes to listen to any-one practice piano.  This is particularly true at 
         our house.  I am terribly annoyed when I know that 
         other people are listening to me practice and wat-ching my play.  The only audience that does not 
         other me is- - -Mom.  She usually sits and knits 
         while she listens to me play.  She criticizes my 
         playing, but it does not seem to bother me.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Last year I played violin at Teachers College 
         High School.  We called our small class of three 
         students a "String Trio."  Because of the size of 
         the class, we played solos almost every day, and I 
         was gradually beginning to  lose some of my stage-fright.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         No matter how often I play in public, I always 
         have at least a mild case of- - - - - - - - - -Stagefright.

         I have read a lot  of Willa Cather's books and 
         find them interesting.  She tells in a way of 
         understanding in all her books and they never 
         get boring if you like peoneer [pioneer]
         stories.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Here are some of her books:  O Pioneers.  This 
         story which Willa Cather has written is particu-larly written for herself about Bohemians and 
         Scandenavians [Scandinavians]
         , neighbors to each other.  Read the 
         book.

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         <u>The Song of the Lark</u>.  This story is of an Am-erican opera singer and her childhood in the Colo-rado desert and her early struggle in Chicago, her 
         romantic adventures among the cliff dwellers' ruins 
         in Arizona, her splendid triumph on the operatic 
         stage.

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         <u>My Antonia</u> is another good story.  It is packed

      <h3>MY CHRISTMAS MEMORIES</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Howard Bingham</p>
      
      
      <p>
         Some of the happiest memories of my childhood 
         are centered around Christmas time.  We always 
         have a Christmas tree with gifts when we get up 
         Christmas morning.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My mother recalls one Christmas when she sent 
         my brothers and me back to bed four times during 
         the night to finally have us awake the whole 
         household about five a.m.  I remember the high-light for me on this particular Christmas was a 
         red wagon.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         After eating breakfast and examining our gifts 
         left by Santa, we always went to my grandmother's 
         house for a noon-time Christmas dinner of roast 
         turkey, goose, or duck with cranberries and dress-ing, mince and pumpkin pie, fruit cake made by 
         Grandmother, and everything in the way of food any 
         one can imagine.  All my cousins, brothers, and 
         sisters, and even the grownups, ate until they 
         were practically unconscious.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         
         Then we op-ened gifts which 
         the relatives always exchanged. 
         Each year the procedure was 
         the same.  Then all the young 
         folks went out sleigh riding, 
         skating, or play-ing games while 
         the women washed the dishes after 
         dinner.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Since we are now older, we 
         celebrate Christ-mas in our own 
         home, often with a lot of aunts, uncles, and cous-ins helping us.

         This will be the first Christmas any member of 
         our family of ten has had to be away from home, 
         but I know my brother, who is away, will have a 
         lot of pleasant memories of past Christmases.  We 
         all hope he will be home again by next Christmas.

      <h3>BOYS WHO SMOKE</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Martha Webb</p>
      
      
      <p>
         All races have found something to smoke.  People 
         down through the ages have been smoking powdered 
         herbs, grasses, and medical powders.  Indians were 
         the first to smoke tobacco.  They taught the colo-nists how to raise and use it.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Young people have been given a healthy body and 
         talents.  When they take to smoking they are wast-ing health, talent, and money.  Young people are 
         more susceptible to injuries from smoking than are 
         adults.  Those who smoke never live as long as 
         those who do not.  Smoking shortens their wind and 
         causes a cough.  It also breaks down their health. 
         The latter isn't something money can buy after it 
         is lost.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Boys can't impress other people by smoking. 
         Anyone can learn to smoke- - even a five year old. 
         It's not an art, as some boys would like us to 
         believe.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         To my way of thinking there are three distinct 
         types of youthful smokers:
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Those who say:
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         "I'm tough, see?  I'm fifteen years old, but 
         you think I look twenty-one?"
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Number two:  The type who act like Humphrey 
         Bogart and take long drags at their cigarettes and 
         manufacture a tough look in their eyes.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Number three:  They type who act as if they have 
         been smoking all their lives, when in reality only 
         lately has it become a habit.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         They don't fool us a bit and it doesn't make 
         them look more manly.  Besides, who wants to be 
         
         <a href="1946/1946_10.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_10.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         near a boy who smells like a smoke stack.  They 
         look rather silly with a cigarette dangling out of 
         the corner of their mouth.  Anyway we prefer the 
         wholesome Van Johnson type.  We don't like to see 
         boys start bad habits which will last them all 
         their lives.

         Youth Week is observed by all young people of 
         the Protestant Churches in North America and is 
         sponsored by the United Christian Youth Movement. 
         During this week many activities are carried out 
         in the local churches and schools.  Some of the 
         activities to take place in Lincoln include serv-ices in the churches given by the young people on 
         Sunday, January 27, a city-wide party that will be 
         held at the First Plymouth Congregational Church 
         on February 1, and a city-wide rally to be held 
         February 3, at one of the local churches.

         Youth Week began more than thirty years ago in 
         the annual celebration of the birthday of Christ-ian Endeavor, February 2.  With the growth of the 
         United Christian Youth Movement (continent wide, 
         interdenominational, representing 10,000,000 Prot-estant young people) there grew a need for a 
         united observance.

         Youth Week is a United Effort to Win Youth for 
         the Church.

      <h3>TRIPPING THE LIGHT FANTASTIC</h3>
      
      <h4>(Consisting of a critical analysis of the positions most commonly used therein)</h4>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Twyla Dobbins</p>

         Dancing is a great American sport.  It provides 
         entertainment not only for the people who partici-pate bus also for those who watch.  Perhaps it is 
         even more enjoyable to be among the watchers.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I have often wished I were an orchestra member 
         who could travel over the national playing for dan-ces.  Then I could observe the different positions 
         used in sections other than my own locality.  As 
         it is, I shall have to content myself with a de-tailed description of the dancing postures with 
         which I am familiar.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Some couples use the far-away position.  It is 
         formed thus:  The couple stand as far apart as 
         possible, close their eyes, reach out and grab for 
         each other's waist and shoulder.  The results are 
         disastrous!  There they are, dancing away- - -but 
         the way they look!  It's as good as a movie to 
         watch them.  About four feet apart, they struggle 
         to get farther apart but succeed only in making 
         certain parts of their anatomy protrude in a very 
         undignified manner.  This version of the dance is 
         very common.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         There is also the "cuddle-up" position which 
         is usually practised [practiced]
          by c.f.'s ("educated foxes," 
         more commonly known as "wolves.")  This is just 
         the opposite of the far-away position.  The man 
         tries to choke the girl, while she, not to be out-done, proves her possession of a superwoman grip 
         by clutching his shoulder tightly.  Instead of im-pressing the innocent by-stander with the beauty 
         
         <a href="1946/1946_12.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_12.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         of their passion, they seem to be in the throes of
         a violent antipathy.  Perhaps they believe their
         attitude appears to be that of lovers- -but oh, 
         brother!
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Dancing on one's feet is a good idea.  So many 
         people seem to do it.  However, dancing on someone 
         else's feet is also a very common practice.  The 
         latter is not particularly popular with the person 
         to whom the feet belong.  For some reason, each 
         individual likes to dance on his own feet, but 
         does not care to have others dance on them as 
         well.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         In order to avoid stepping on other dancers' 
         feet, many participants in the sport take long, 
         sweeping steps.  They may think they look graceful, 
         but they really resemble nothing so much as assor-ted ostriches walking about the dance floor.  This 
         method usually eliminates the problem of stepping 
         on people's feet, but who wants to look like an 
         ostrich?
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         One frequently meets the boy who is obviously 
         doing a dance of duty.  His mouth is set in a firm, 
         unpleasant line; and, frowning menacingly at one 
         and all, he pushes his unhappy partner around the 
         floor as if she wore a sack of meal.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Then there is the couple who seem utterly ob-livious to everything and everyone around them. 
         As they gaze soulfully at each other, their eyes 
         gradually droop shut, and they imagine themselves 
         in Heaven.  The other dancers express their dis-approval by frowning and muttering.  Finally, the 
         "out of this world" couple are brought rudely back 
         to earth by a series of bumps and collisions.  Does 
         this bother them?  On, no!  They dance ahead as if 
         there had been no interruption.  At least the other 
         dancers retire and watch them as they drift 
         through dreamland.  The floor is theirs, and they 
         use it, too.
         </p>
      <a href="1946/1946_13.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_13.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The show-off couple can be found upon any dance 
         floor.  Their main purpose is to be outlandish and 
         different.  They will dance in any way in order to 
         make themselves the center of attention.  They 
         will execute rapid turns, hop, jump, or even turn 
         somersaults in order to be the chief attraction. 
         This mode of dancing is commonly called "jitter-bugging."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Yes, dancing is fun; but it's better than a 
         three-ring circus to watch other people trip the 
         light fantastic.
         </p>
      
      
      
      
      
                  
      
      <h3>NEGROES AND WHITES</h3> 
      
      
      <p class="byline">Lee Barnhill</p>
      
      
          
      
      
      <p>
         I used to look at a negro as a person who was 
         sort of dirty and dangerous because I lived in the 
         South a great deal of my life-time.  Where I lived 
         a white man who killed a negro was put in one night 
         and let out the next morning, but if a negro killed 
         a white, the negro was put to death immediately.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Down South a negro has his own school, his own 
         church and his own side of the railroad track; but 
         here they sometimes go to school with whites. 
         For example:  the other day I saw two girls walk-ing down the road from school.  They were about 
         six and four, the older a negro, the younger a 
         white.  They had their arms around each other like 
         a pair of sisters.  Down south if a white mother 
         saw this she probably would have had the negro's 
         parents put in jail, which is very easy to do.  I 
         think, if we would not curse the negroes so much 
         and let them be more like us, we would have much 
         better luck with them.  I think there would be 
         fewer fights and killings.  When I get on a bus 
         lots of times I see a negro in one corner all by 
         <a href="1946/1946_14.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_14.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         himself.  The whites won't sit by him at all. 
         They act as if they are better than he is.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I had a very good friend once, a man about fifty 
         years old.  He was a negro.  He liked me very much 
         and would do almost anything for me.  Some negroes 
         are all right but others are just born with crook-edness.  We had negroes working for us who had all 
         come down in a truck from Austin or Houston.  The 
         whites just haul them around in trucks like horses. 
         Wherever the driver of the truck takes them that's 
         where they go.  They live in tents, caves or right 
         out in the open with only a couple of blankets. 
         Their usual work is in the cotton fields, hoeing 
         or picking.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I think we should treat the negroes better.
         </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h3>MY HOME</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Ruthie Merklin</p>
      
      
      <p>
         My home, the State Home for Dependent Children, 
         is located at University Place, 5903 Walker Avenue. 
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Several years ago the home of Mr. and Mrs. C. 
         C. White was bought by the State for $32,000.  Be-fore this time the State Home was located on 
         twelfth street.  Since White Hall was purchased 
         the State has added five different main buildings. 
         Now most of the children are located on the 
         grounds.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         White Hall is the main building.  Here are lo-cated the main offices and employees' kitchen and 
         dining room.  On the third floor of White Hall the 
         senior girls and I live.  Here are also the super-intendent's apartment and welfare workers' offices.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Next is the girls' Training Cottage.  The Cot-tage is a large two story white house where girls 
         stay for training when they become twelve years 
         old.
         </p>
      <a href="1946/1946_15.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_15.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         At the cottage the girls learn to cook, sew, 
         and clean.  After they are fourteen to fifteen 
         years old, they go to White Hall.  In the basement 
         of the Cottage the fifth and sixth grade have 
         their school room.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Benson Hall is named after Mrs. Benson who was 
         a chairman of the Board of Control.  It consists 
         of the main kitchen and dining room in the base-ment, the first and second nersery [nursery]
          on the first floor 
         and the clinic room or doctors' offices.  The sec-ond floor is where the smaller girls have their 
         department.  The third floor has a dentist's room 
         and a hospital where all the children are isolated 
         when they first come into the institution before 
         they are put in a department.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         On the east side the boys have their department. 
         In the basement of this building the first four 
         grades have their school room.  On the first and 
         second floor the small boys from four to nine also 
         the large boys from nine to fourteen have their 
         department here.  The third floor consists of rooms 
         for employees.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Besides these main buildings we have a large 
         garage, a laundry and a school house for sixth to 
         eighth grade.  During the past two years we have 
         added two new building, one by the school for re-creation or play and then we completed late this 
         fall a large cave to store our canned fruit and 
         vegetables, potatoes, cabbage, etc., we raised 
         in the summer.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Then out two miles we have a farm for boys from 
         fourteen to eighteen.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The boys have a man and wife to take care of 
         them.  They help put in the crops and harvest them, 
         do the house cleaning, chores, get meals, and do 
         the dishes.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         They get up around 5:30 or 6:00 and go to bed 
         at 8:30 or 9:00.
         </p>
      <a href="1946/1946_16.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_16.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Mrs. Mouden, our superintendent, also bought 
         the farm since she has been at the home.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         We also have the first nursery and second nur-sery.  In the first nursery the babies are from 
         three weeks to two years old.  After they leave 
         the first nursery they go to the second nursery 
         where they stay from two years to four or five 
         years, when the girls go to Benson Hall and the 
         boys to West Side or Hager Hall.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         At the home we have seventy-two employees at 
         the present time.  That includes the file clerk, 
         bookkeeper, and superintendent and stenographers. 
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         We also have plenty of entertainment; we always 
         have parties and mixers.  We always celebrate the 
         fourth [Fourth]
         of July and all other holidays.  In the 
         fall we go to the Circus and State Fair.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Well this is about all I can say, so I'll quit 
         by saying that I am proud of my home.

      <h3>JAZZ MANIACS</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">John Moritz</p>
      
      
      <p> 
         Have you ever met a maniac; a jazz maniac, I
         mean?  They are the people who think sharps, and 
         dance flats.  All they ever think of is music. 
         Don't get my wrong, I like music, and jazz, but 
         not this type.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         At a dance you're dancing peacefully with a 
         girl when somebody stops the victrola and puts on 
         a music plate he brought from home.  Out of this 
         record comes forth sounds as though the roof were 
         falling in.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Two wierdly-clad [weirdly-clad]
          figures, maniacs, in other 
         words, jump on to the floor, and start hitting 
         each other over the head.  Then they start some 
         very interesting aerobatics.  He grabs her, she 
         <a href="1946/1946_17.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_17.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         grabs him.  Wham!  Big fight!  They call that dan-cing.  When the <u>music</u> stops, they drag each other 
         off the floor and congratulate themselves on what 
         a swell dance they had.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         You start dancing again, when who should heave 
         into view but our bouncing buddies.  They jazz to 
         a waltz.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         After throwing you off the floor, our maniacs 
         do a series of wiggles that would make Houdini 
         crawl.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Now that I've given you a general description 
         of their dancing technique, let me show you how 
         they talk.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         He:  "How about bashin' the bundle with me, 
         bee?"
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Silly, isn't it?
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               
         She:  "Not 'til you perambulate around to the 
         glass gaze and slick down your mop."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Did you ever hear such stuff?  I didn't until 
         then.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I asked a friend of mine, who is one of those 
         moon gazers, to go to a psychiatrist, but he re-fused.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         There's not much more to say on the topic ex-cept that the maniac piles his home full of re-cords of every type and description.  He treasures 
         each one more than the next and will murder you if 
         you break one of the million.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         So, for quieter living, don't go near one.

      <h3> ICE SKATING OR OTHERWISE</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Marian Waddell</p>
      
      
      <p>
         Being of sound mind (?) and body, I hereby be-queath- - - - -sounds rather pessimistic doesn't it? 
         Well, the ice skating season is here again and I 
         shall soon be making my yearly attempt to learn to 
         ice skate.  Therefore, before I start out, I feel 
         a will might be a very good idea.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Ice skating can truly be an art, when it is 
         done properly.  It is a demonstration of true 
         grace and beauty, however, my skating is not an 
         example of either one.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The first time I went ice skating, I started 
         out with high hopes; after all, it looks so simple. 
         First, I put on my skates- -well that was easy any-way- -then I proceeded to attempt to stand up. 
         After a fierce battle to get my skates to stop 
         wobbling and actually get my balance, I started 
         out.  My skates seemed to have a difference of 
         opinion concerning the direction I was going and I 
         sat down, not very gently, I might add.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Why something which looks so simple 
         should be so arduous I will never 
         understand.  The fight those two little 
         skates can put up never ceases to amaze 
         me.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My patience is wearing thin in the 
         face of so many defeats, so if you see 
         me starting out with a pair of ice 
         skates and a "do or die" expression in 
         my eyes, don't be alarmed, I won't kill 
         anyone, at least not intentionally, I 
         merely wish to learn to ice skate.

      <h3>THREE GREAT DOCUMENTS IN THEHISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Ruby Hock</p>
      
      
      <p>
         The Declaration of Independence announced the 
         freedom of the Thirteen Colonies from Great 
         Britain.  Thomas Jefferson was responsible for the 
         drafting of the Declaration of Independence.  Many 
         phrases were dropped from his original copy by 
         Congress.  One of the most important of these was 
         the clause which abolished slavery in the United 
         States.  The Southern Congressmen wouldn't let 
         this issue pass and it was therefore taken away 
         from the document.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Congress studied the document on the sec-ond, third, and fourth of July.  It was signed late 
         in the afternoon on July 4, 1776.  It was read 
         publicly on the following Monday.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The document accuses the king of trespassing up-on the rights of the people.  It declares all men 
         equal and acknowledges the right of everyone to 
         life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The states had now thrown off the British yoke 
         and stood without a government to hold them to-gether.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Articles of Confederation was the next step 
         in the forming of our great nation.  The same day 
         the Continental Congress ordered a committee to 
         draft the Declaration of Independence, another 
         group was organized to prepare the Articles of 
         Confederation.  A month after the Declaration of 
         Independence had been signed, the Articles of Con-federation were submitted to Congress for approval. 
         This document was subjected to debate for sixteen 
         months in Congress and even after being adopted by 
         
         <a href="1946/1946_20.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_20.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         Congress toward the end of 1777, it was not rati-fied until March, 1781, when the war was drawing to 
         a close
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Franklin's plan of union of 1775 was not ac-cepted by Albany Congress, but some of the most 
         important features of the two documents are iden-tical.  The Articles of Confederation provided for 
         a Congress in which every state was entitled to one 
         vote and was represented by a delegation whose 
         members were appointed annually as the legislature 
         of the state might direct and whose expenses were 
         paid by the state and were subject to recall.  In 
         other words it was a council of states whose re-presentatives has little independence of action.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Extensive powers were granted to the Congress. 
         It could enter into treaties, declare war or estab-lish peace, coin money and establish post offices. 
         But none of these powers could be exercised with-out consent of nine states and even if the 
         consent was given, there was nothing to make the 
         states abide by the decision of Congress.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         No executive was provided for except that Con-gress was authorized to appoint such officials as 
         it considered necessary to run the government. 
         Congress might be called upon to settle disputes 
         between states and establish courts for the trial 
         of piracy on the high seas.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The plan of government was there but it had no 
         force behind it.  Congress might declare war, but 
         the states might decline to participate in it; Con-gress might enter into treaties, but it could not 
         make the states live up to it.  Congress could 
         borrow money, but it could not be sure of repaying 
         it; and Congress could settle disputes, but it had 
         no way of making the parties accept the decision.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The union was ready for a stronger constitution. 
         The Constitutional Convention was first called for 
         the purpose of amending the Articles of Confedera-tion and there were some delegates who stayed with 
         <a href="1946/1946_21"><img src="">1946/1946_21</img></a>
         
         
         this purpose throughout the whole convention. There 
         were others, however, who realized that the Arti-cles of Confederation were not satisfactory no  nomat-ter [no mat-ter]
          how changed they might become.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Constitutional Convention which met in 
         Philadelphia in 1787 was the most important con-vention every [ever]
          held in the United States.  The Con-federation under the Articles of Confederation was 
         a failure and if the new nation was to be justi-fied in the eyes of the world, it must show itself 
         capable of effective union.  This Conventionand [Convention and]
          
         its outcome would mark a turning point in the his-tory of the world and all men presentwere [present were]
          affected 
         by the importance of the task before them.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         All sessions of the Convention were held in sec-ret.  The representation was by states and the 
         average attendance throughout the convention was 
         only a little more than thirty.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         George Washington was chosen as presiding offi-cer of the Convention.  Personalityand [Personality and]
          character 
         played a large part in the discussions and debates 
         at the Convention.  In such a small group, person-ality counted as much as weighty argument.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         James Madison was, next to Washington, the most 
         important member of the Virginian delegation.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Gouverneur Morris and Ben Franklin were the im-portant delegates from Pennsylvania.  The first 
         plan proposed was the Virginia Plan which called 
         for a completely new government.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The principal [principle]
          features were the organisation [organization]
          of 
         a legislature of two houses with increased powers, 
         the establishment of a separate executive, and the 
         creation of an independent judiciary.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         To check this drift toward radical change, New 
         Jersey and Connecticut presented the New Jersey 
         Plan which was in sharp contrast to the Virginia 
         plan [Plan]
          and called for only a revision of the Arti-cles of Confederation.  After a short discussion,
         however, the Virginia plan [Plan]
          won.
         </p>
      <a href="1946/1946_22.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_22.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The dividing line at the Convention soon became 
         noticeable.  It was the same one as in the Congress 
         of Confederation- - the line between the small states 
         and the large states.  On July 16, the great com-promise of the Constitution was made.  There were 
         to be two houses in Congress.  The lower with re-presentation according to the population and the upper 
         with each state having two votes.  After this was 
         accepted, the Convention proceeded rapidly and on 
         much hotter terms.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         A committee of five was named to frame the Con-stitution.  This committee made use of the New 
         Jersey Plan, the Virginia Plan, the Articles of 
         Confederation, and for the rest it depended large-ly upon the constitutions of the states.  They 
         drew up the draft in ten days.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The one clause referring to Congress in the 
         Constitution that is the most important is found 
         in Article I, Section 8, part 18, which gives Con-gress authority to make any laws it thinks are 
         necessary to carry on the government.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Constitution provided for a Federal Supreme 
         Court to settle all matters involving the inter-pretation of the law.  The Court assumed a great 
         power not actually provided for in the Constitu-tion.  This was the authority to declare laws of 
         Congress null and void.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Constitution also provided for the single 
         executive.  In making the provision, the Constitu-tion created an office which had never before been 
         in existence.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The constitution has an effective way of check-ing any over ambitious president.  The Congress 
         can overrule his veto by a two-thirds vote in both 
         houses.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Constitution was unanimously accepted in 
         Congress and sent to the states for their approval. 
         The Constitution had to have nine states ratify it 
         before it could go into effect.  Delaware was the 
         <a href="1946/1946_23.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_23.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         first to ratify the Constitution on December 7, 
         1787.  The others followed and the Constitution 
         went into effect on June 21, 1789.  The other four 
         states accepted the Constitution later and on May 
         21, 1790, all Thirteen Colonies belonged to the 
         union.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         A great experiment was made in establishing a 
         nation under the principal [principle]
          of self-government, and 
         the whole world anxiously awaited its success or 
         failure.

      <p>
         We don't know more about the origin of the Greek 
         people than we do about the founders of Egypt or 
         Babylon.  Our knowledge of them begins about the 
         time when the Assyrians had conquered most of west-ern Asia.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         For 200 years after the time of these Oriental 
         monarchs, Greek life and thought blossomed out at 
         their best.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The ancestors of the Greeks of historic times 
         came south from the valley of the Danube, or pos-sibly from the region north of the Black Sea.  The 
         Greeks later called themselves Hellenes and their 
         land Hellans.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The invaders didn't come all at once but in 
         waves about two hundred years apart.  There were 
         four divisions of them, the Achaeans, the Aeolians, 
         Ionians, and Dorians.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         In about 1100 B. C. a big wave of Dorians came 
         into the Peloponnesus, the southern peninsula of 
         Greece.  They drove out the people already living 
         there.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         You would have found among the people of ancient 
         Greece every trait and quality that human beings 
         ever possessed.  The Greeks were very reasonable. 
         <a href="1946/1946_24.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_24.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         They took an interest in business, in commerce, in 
         art, in government, in philosophy, and in religion. 
         They were a free-minded people and didn't feel 
         bound by any tradition or habit.  These Greeks 
         were also great builders.  Some of the more famous 
         buildings that are still standing are "the Porch 
         of the Maidens" and "the Theseum" at Athens.  On 
         these buildings we noticed three types of columns. 
         These columns were the Doric, Ionic, and the Cor-inthian.
         </p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Doric column was the
         simplest of the three columns. 
         It was made more for heavy use 
         then were the Ionic and Corin-thian columns.  The Doric col-umn also has no formal base 
         and a very simple capital. </p>
      
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ionic capital had de-signs of scrolls on it.  This 
         column was more slender than the Doric column.</p>
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The most ornate of the three columns was the 
         Corinthian, which was used more by the Romans than 
         the Greeks.  It is said that the artist that made 
         the design got the idea when he saw a basket set 
         on the leaves on an acanthus plant.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Greeks were very superstitious.  They 
         thought that all the gods lived on Mt. Olympus but 
         no Greek had seen, or even thought he had seen, a 
         god there.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         They had many gods.  Some of the Greek gods you 
         are familiar with are Jupiter [Zeus]
         , the king of gods; 
         Neptune [Poseidon]
         , god of the sea; Mercury [Hermes]
         , messenger of the 
         gods, and many more.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Greeks put human weakness and vices as well 
         as good qualities into their gods.  These gods 
         could be jealous, deceitful, and cruel.  They were 
         much like normal people.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The Greeks could easily be led by a smooth 
         talker and they were always ready to give some 
         <a href="1946/1946_25.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_25.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         sympathy. A hero one day was a villain the next 
         in Greece.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Greek life from around 1200 to 800 B. B. is 
         pictured in two poems written by a blind man named 
         Homer.  These two poems were the <u>Iliad</u> and the 
         <u>Odyssey</u>.  Every person of culture in Greece knew 
         these poems.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         These poems tell about the latter part of the 
         war between the Greeks and the people of Troy 
         in Asia Minor (about 1194 B. B. to 1184 B. C.), and 
         of the experience of Odysseus on his return home 
         after Troy had been captured.

         The people of ancient Greece were mostly farm-ers, fishermen, or traders on the sea.  Although 
         they made their own weapons and armor for war, 
         there were a few skilled tradesmen among them.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         They thought that they were all descended from 
         a common ancestor, whom they called Hellen.  All 
         who weren't Greeks were "Barbarians."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Some of the Greeks organized in leagues, or am-phistyonics.

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Each city was jealous of each other because it 
         was afraid the other might get more powerful, so 
         they had many wars.
         </p>

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         One of the greatest of all unifying factors was 
         the Olympic Games.  These were held every year at 
         Mt. Olympus.  At these games they had many contests 
         of physical skills.  The visitor [victor]
          of these contests 
         was given a head band of olive leaves.

      <h3>BUSES- -TO BE SQUASHED OR NOT TO BE SQUASHED</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Shirley Will</p>
      
      
      <p>
         Unfortunately I do not live at the end of the 
         bus line; and by the time I am ready to make my 
         appearance on the bus, it is fairly crowded.  But 
         <a href="1946/1946_26.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_26.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         wait, we haven't picked up all the other passen-gers.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I wish the bus driver would stop telling us to 
         move to the back of the car.  He doesn't know that 
         some of the passengers are halfway out of the back 
         of the bus.  I wish this ape in front of me would 
         get off my foot.  Maybe if I drop one of my books 
         he will pick it up for me and then kindly remove 
         his big clodhoppers.  Well, here goes.  "Oh, thank 
         you ever so much."  Well, now I can uncurl my toes. 
         Boy what a relief!
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I wonder who's pushing up in front.  I wish 
         they would stop.  Ooh, you big stiff.  "No, you 
         didn't hurt me.  Thanks, I'm quite all right and I 
         think I can manage to pick myself up."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I'd better grab the closest object there is, 
         because the bus is going to stop.  "Just a minute, 
         driver."  Gee whiz, I feel like a fool.  I should 
         have known better than to lean against the door, 
         and fall out as the bus came to a stop and the 
         doors flew open.. Well, anyway, the people got a 
         good laugh out of it and I, well..........
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Just three more blocks and I'll be out of this 
         sardine can.  This time I'll make sure nothing 
         happens when the bus stops.  Oh, golly, where's 
         my shoe?  I know I put both of them on this morn-ing.  Jeepers, I can't go to school with just one 
         shoe.  Why, I'll be the laughing stock of the 
         whole school.  I must have lost it when we had 
         that awful lurch two blocks back.  Ah, there it is 
         under that seat.  But I can't crawl under the seat 
         to get it because it would look ridiculous.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         "Yes, ah, that's my shoe; thank you."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         At that moment I wished the ground would open 
         up and swallow me.  Saved!  The bus has stopped 
         and here's where I get off.  I still think that 
         some of the most embarrassing moments <u>can</u> and <u>do</u> 
         take place on buses.

      <h3>MACBETH BY FAIRES</h3>
      
      
      <p>
         You are about to read 
         a play.  After you have 
         read it, you will wonder 
         why you did, but never-theless, you are about to 
         read it.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         There are two Macbeths. 
         Macbeth by Shakespeare, 
         and Macbeth by Faires.  If 
         you are fool enough to 
         think you are about to 
         read the better of the 
         two, or anything even 
         closely resembled to the 
         better of the two, then 
         either you're crazy, or I 
         am.  You don't know it 
         now, but in the following 
         lines what Faires has done 
         to Shakespeare, shouldn't 
         happen to Smoe and Kilroy 
         put together.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Now, if you still want 
         to read this thing, you 
         must do so at your own 
         risk, as we are not re-sponsible in any way for 
         anything anyone might do, 
         after the smell has 
         drifted away.  Remember, 
         the management is not re-sponsible!!!

      <p>

         Any faint possible resemblance between this and 
         anything Mr. S. wrote is purely coincidental.

      <h3>A Scene from MACBETH</h3>
      
      <p class="byline">by F. Faires (with a little help from Mr. S.)</p>
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The scene is Macbeth's Castle, a very modern 
         castle, as castles go.  Over the door is a bright 
         red neon sign which flashes off and on and reads, 
         "Macbeth's Place, Deliveries in the Rear."  Mac-beth is one of King Duncan's best soldiers, and gets 
         paid very well; as a matter of fact, he has more 
         money than Carter's have Little Liver Pills.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         As the scene opens, Duncan drives up in front 
         of the castle in a sixteen cylinder Buick.  Duncan 
         is tall, dark and has a handsome bank roll.  He is 
         about forty-five, but is still an obvious, up and 
         atom wolf.  He climbs out of the car, and crosses 
         an electric eye beam, which automatically lowers 
         the draw bridge.  He then crosses to the court yard 
         where he finds Lady Macbeth sipping pink lemonade, 
         and drooling over a picture of Van Johnson........
         </p>
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: (very sly) Hello, stranger, long time no see!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: (even slyer) I thought it was about time for you to drop in, you wolf.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: I am not a wolf!  I'm just an enthusiastic  kitten.</p>
      (Enter Ross)
      
      
      <p class="sp">Ross: Did you ring for me?</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: Well, that bell didn't toll for Pino-cico [Pino-cchio]
         .  Here, lock my Van Johnson picture in the safe.</p>(Exit Ross)
      <a href="1946/1946_29.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_29.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: It's so lonesome being king all by myself, why don't you jump in your airplane and come up and see me sometime?</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: What?  And leave Macbeth here alone?</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: Oh, what do you care for that drip???</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: Be quiet Duncan.  After all he's one of the best husbands I ever had.</p>
      
      <p>(Enter Macbeth)</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: So this is what goes on when my back is turned.  Duncan, I told you not to come here!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: I can come here if I want!  After all, I'm  still king.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: That settles it!  I'm going home to father!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: But you can't do that, I need you in the  army.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: I can if I want!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: Over my dead body!</p>
      
      <p>(Macbeth takes out a gun and shoots Duncan.)</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Duncan: (dying) All right, go home to your old father, see if I care! (dies)</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: Now just look what you've done.  He  flopped over on my very best rose bush.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: I'm sorry, remind me to be more careful next time.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: Say, do you know that this leaves the way open for you to be king???</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: I hadn't thought of that.  Being king would be nice.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: Who knows, if we keep this up, we might even move to Chicago.  You could hold people up, and I could shop lift.</p>
      
      <p>(Enter Ross)</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Ross: Banquo is here.</p>
      
      <p>(Enter Banquo and looks at the body.)</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Banquo: My, my!  The king is murdered, what a pity!  That reminds me, read any good books lately????</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Ross: Never mind.  Who's going to tell Malcom about this????</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: Oh dear.  I forgot about him.  I don't 
         <a href="1946/1946_30.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_30.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         suppose he'll like this very well, will he?????</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: I don't suppose.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Banquo: Oh, I just love gossip!  I'll run and tell him</p>(Exit Banquo)
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: Now what will I do???</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: We're in a jam!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Ross: There's the door bell.  I'll answer it.</p>
      
      <p>(Answers door.)</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: Well, who is it???</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Ross: It's Malcom and.......</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: My, he got here fast didn't he????</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: Oh they can do anything like that in these plays.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Ross: He says he wants to cut your head off!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: Well, tell him to come right in...WHAT?? My head???  Oh dear, oh dear, what will I do? Hide me someone!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: I think I'll kill myself!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Ross: Hold everything!  A letter just came for Lady Macbeth.</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: (read letter)Quick!  Pack your suitcase and we'll slip out the back way.  "We'll have to hurry to catch the next train!</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Macbeth: But where can we go????</p>
      
      <p class="sp">Lady Macbeth: To Hollywood.  M.G.M. wants you to play stand-in for Boris Karloff.</p>

      <h3>OLD FRIENDS OF THE FAMILY</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Jenibel Briggs</p>
      
      
      <p>
         They ought to be put behind bars.  They ought 
         to be taken before a court and convicted.  These 
         people who make unexpected visits are real crimi-nals!  They burst in when you don't want to see 
         anyone, especially not them.  It would seem in- 
         <a href="1946/1946_31.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_31.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         credible if they came when a person had the time 
         and inclination to entertain them.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         
         It seems to be a joyous time for everyone but 
         me when these old friends pop in.  Everyone else 
         appears to enjoy himself.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         
         Seldom do they have any important purpose in 
         coming, but regardless, I have to appear extremely 
         hospitable when I am introduced.  They always say, 
         "My dear," or "Why, the last time I saw you, you 
         were only this high."  These platitudes revolt me 
         no end.  I can't remember whether I had ever seen 
         them or not.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         When they arrive, they usually let it be known 
         that they can stay only fifteen or twenty minutes, 
         but these fifteen or twenty minutes develop into 
         hours.  My mother urges them to stay for dinner, 
         and they accept her invitation very willingly.  My 
         heart sinks into my shoes when I have to be the 
         "aide de camp" in the kitchen, which ruins my 
         evening plans to go to the basketball game.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My heart drops still deeper when Mother invites 
         them to stay all night and take the noon train the 
         following day.  The last straw is their acceptance 
         to stay.  My room is transformed immediately into 
         a guest room and I spend the night on the daven-port.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         By morning, I have a still neck and an extremely 
         wicked attitude toward old friends of the family.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         By the time the breakfast dishes are done, I 
         start trying to get our guests off so there will 
         be no danger of their missing the noon train.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The goodbyes are long and sorrowful affairs for 
         everyone except me.  As I watch, beaming secretly 
         to myself, I notice a cobweb forming in the door-way.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Finally, they walk down the sidewalk and I give 
         a sigh of relief for I am always happy when 
         people leave after such visitations.  Such people 
         need to do more reading in etiquette books.

      <h3>HISTORY OF ALGEBRA</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Audrey Flood</p>
      
      
      <p>
         History has two definitions.  One, it is 
         everything that happened in the past; the second, 
         it is a written record of special things which 
         happened in the past.  As an algebra student, I 
         shall tell you what I know about the history of 
         algebra in each of these ways.
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         First, there is everything 
         that happened to algebra in 
         the past.  Al-gebra is said 
         to have been started in 
         Egypt, as many geometric and 
         algebraic prog-ressions were 
         found in their ancient papers. 
         In Greece, al-gebra was writ-ten in geomet-ric forms, and 
         verbal problems which are the 
         basis of those used in our 
         books today, were worked. 
         Diophantus com-piled the alge-braic knowledge of the Greeks 
         into one volume.  In this book, he made a great 
         contribution by using symbols for unknown quantit-ies and powers.  He spent most of his time study-ing problems in which the solution was indetermin-ate.  Hypatia, the first known woman mathemetician [mathematician]
          
         wrote many commentaries on the works of Diophantus 
         and she followed his theories.  In India, the 
         Hindus were interested in series, and linear and 
         quadratic equations.  In the twelfth century, 
         Europe became interested in algebra and two men 
         were brought to Frederick II, where they had a 
         
         <a href="1946/1946_33.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_33.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         mathematical tournament.  In this tournament, 
         Fibonacci added to his prestige as a genius in 
         algebraic analysis.  Gradually, algebra spread 
         throughout the world as a common study of 
         mathematics.
         </p>

         Second, the written record of the common pu-pil's algebra that has happened in the past is:

      <h3>PERFUME AND THE LADIES (AND THE MEN)</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">- -"Rog" Phipps</p>

         Perfume, according to Webster, is "a substance 
         that emits an agreeable odor."  It is generally 
         known that this substance which emits such an 
         agreeable odor is usually a young lady wearing some 
         one of over one hundred thousand different kinds 
         of perfumes.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The purpose of perfume is to allure.  (That's 
         what I hear, anyway.)  Many a lass has found per-fume to be her answer in enticing a man.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         There are over one hundred thousand different 
         kinds of perfumes.  They can be roughly classified 
         into two groups:  the potent and the non-potent. 
         The average young lady has several kinds of non-potent perfumes sitting around on the top of her 
         dressing table, but now and then we run across 
         someone who is wearing a potent perfume.  The 
         effect is flooring.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         What is a woman without perfume?  Perfume is the 
         whipped cream on her ginger-bread, the a-la on her 
         <a href="1946/1946_34.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_34.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         a-la-mode, the cherry on her sundae, the sugar in 
         her coffee, and the butter on her toast.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Have you read the latest perfume ads?  If not, 
         you have no idea what perfume means to modern 
         misses.  Perfume is....."the lilting, lingering, 
         loveliness....for you alone!  Elusive....provoca-tive....tantalizingly unforgettable, intriguing as 
         the lengthening shadows of twilight,....stirring as 
         that first star-canopied moment alone!  The frag-rance that weaves a subtle spell and softly whis-pers 'you'."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Perfume, the magazine ads try to imply, can 
         seemingly transform a woman into almost anything. 
         She is either "a heaven-sent angel," "a white 
         flame," "devastating," or a "beau catcher."  These 
         perfumes are supposed to have quite an effect on 
         the men, as their names imply.  Actually, I don't 
         think men pay the least attention to the perfume 
         women wear unless it is some of the more potent 
         type.  This potent perfume bears a striking resem-blance to any delousing fluid.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         If the modern maiden wishes to inspire jealousy, 
         all she does is don some "Jealousy" perfume.  If 
         the young lady wants to be devasting, all she has 
         to do is put a drop of perfume behind each ear and 
         (as the perfume ads claim) she will become as dev-astating as her hat.  And oh!  what a hat!
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         We of the masculine sex do not realize what per-fume means to the ladies.  As some perfume ads put 
         it:  "a perfume made of all the things you love," 
         or "Adventure, mixed with mystery, gay and lilting 
         as ballet music."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Why don't girls wear perfumes called "caramel," 
         "butterscotch," "apple pie," or "chocolate," in-stead of the fumes called "Indifference," or "An-nihilation"?
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Remember boys, as Kipling once said it, "The 
         female of the species is more deadly than the 
         male!"

      <h3>ONE TOO MANY SISTERS</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Roberta Flory</p>
      
      
      
      <p>
         Little brothers- -ugh! 
         - -many times I have heard 
         them spoken of in just 
         that way- -brothers!  Some 
         even hold contempt for 
         them in their voices- - 
         brothers!  Well, what 
         about sisters?  Doesn't 
         anyone ever have an onery 
         sister, a mean little 
         sister?  Well, let me tell 
         you about mine.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My sister's name is 
         Georgia Ann and she is 13 
         years old.  She is as tall 
         as I am and probably will turn out to be a taller 
         person.  I might say she was tall for her age, but 
         compared to some of the young giants in her grade, 
         she is a "pip-squeak."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Her disposition is variable.  The only way I 
         can describe it is by quoting a nursery rhyme. 
         "When she is good, she is very, very good...when 
         she is bad, she is horrid."  As I write more you 
         will get the general idea.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The biggest problem in our life is the problem 
         of sharing.  Now that she is "growing up," she 
         thinks she can get certain compensations, things 
         like getting out of the housework that she never 
         really helped with anyway- - -.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I'm going to ask a question.  Would I have to 
         share my bedroom if she wore [were]
          a brother?  Now I'll 
         
         <a href="1946/1946_36.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_36.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         answer it.  Most certainly not!!  If she were a 
         brother I would have a room all by myself.  Oh, 
         happy day, what a glorious thought.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Connected with this thought is another- - - I 
         would so much like having a closet of my own. 
         Really, I would.  It would be worlds simpler but, 
         no, she's a sister and sisters share.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My bicycle is a much disputed matter.  When it 
         was new, it was given to me.  Georgia was small 
         then but in the last few years she has learned how 
         to ride.  Now the bicycle is jointly owned and 
         mostly by the little "joint."  (She thinks.)
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         She is growing up; that I can't deny, but she 
         just popped up.  A year ago she couldn't being to 
         wear my clothes.  Now they fit her better than they 
         do me.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         It had been a hard and fast rule at our home 
         that the girls, meaning Georgia and I, should not 
         wear each other's clothes.  Of course, that's all 
         changed; now the rule is if you see anything you 
         like, grab it and run!  No, it's really not quite 
         so bad.  Only once in a while does she wear my 
         stuff and then only with my permission.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Can someone tell me what is the proper time 
         for a thirteen-year-old to go to bed?  Georgia's 
         motto is, "Don't go to bed until you just can't 
         stand up any more and then if possibly hold out 
         just a little bit longer."  Then, when she goes to 
         bed, she wants me to follow directly.  Well, some-times I'm willing, but other times it's almost im-possible.  Of course, that's my story and we won't 
         go into that.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Who does the dishes?  A problem in every home 
         is who does the dishes?  My sister argues, "Let 
         Bobby do them; she's older and the older ones help 
         more."  My argument is "Let Georgia help; she's 
         younger and should have to do things like that." 
         Oh well, you can't win, so why try?
         </p>
      <a href="1946/1946_37.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_37.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I have a suggestion to make to the Journal 
         company.  Why don't they send two papers to us in-stead of one?  It would simplify life so much. 
         When we hear the paper hit the porch, we start in 
         our fifty-yard dash.  The lucky one gets it, the 
         other one usually gets a banged head or a skinned 
         knee.  "Why shouldn't I get the evening paper first; 
         I'm the younger."  As I said before, you can't win.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         But, all in all, everything included, she's 
         not so bad.  Sisters, in general, all have their 
         good points.  Their companionship is something to 
         treasure.  Their help with the work is good, when 
         you can get it.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         My sister's personality is developing more 
         every day.  She is getting a fine sense of humor. 
         It's only once in a while that something gets 
         under her skin.  As she is getting older, she is 
         getting more sensible and dependable.  That is 
         something fine to see.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         I don't want anyone to get me wrong.  I love 
         my sister and I wouldn't change her for a million 
         like her, but sometimes she gets under my skin and 
         this is the only way I can think of to get rid of 
         it.  Oh well, that's life.

      <h3>I'LL BE HOME FOR CHRISTMAS</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Ardeen Miller</p>
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         "I'll be home for Christmas," the song sand 
         from under Diane's fingers as she played the piano. 
         There was a large tree at one end of the room 
         beautifully decorated with colored balls, tinsel, 
         Santa Claus, angels, and a huge silver star at the 
         top.  Near by was the fire-place with holly and 
         candles on it.  This room, the snow falling lazily 
         outside, the fire in the fire-place brought back 
         memories- -memories of her brother Cal.
         </p>
      <a href="1946/1946_38.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_38.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The last time Cal was in this room was three 
         years ago.  He sang songs, he joked, and he popped 
         popcorn but- -Cal would never do those things again. 
         Cal was dead, killed at Salerno..
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Diane remembered the times Cal played football, 
         even got his nose broken once.  Gosh, he looked 
         funny with that big bandage on his face.  There 
         was the time he swam at Crow Lake and got sun-burned.  He looked like a beet!  Cal sang in the 
         Church choir; he was there every Sunday.  Diane 
         thought of the many girls in Cal's life.  Marge, 
         Georgia, Sally, Shirley, and the last one was 
         Carol; he had loved them all.  He loved this room, 
         he loved Christmas, he loved everything it stood 
         for, the birth of Jesus, the manger, and the glory 
         of giving gifts.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Cal will never be here for Christmas again; 
         he'll never sit down to a huge dinner with all the 
         trimmings, of turkey, potatoes and gravy, cranber-ries, jellies, salads, nuts, candies, and mince 
         pie.  Diane thought of the family sitting down to 
         the table with that missing face.  Cal always sat 
         next to her, kidding her, and telling her not to 
         eat too much.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Cal will never be home for another Christmas, 
         he died so that we all might enjoy a free one. 
         Yes, Cal is dead, but Diane silently thanked God 
         for Cal and the other boys who died for- -Christmas.

      <h3>THE CORN COB</h3>
      
      
      <p>
         Well, Old Man Winter is a-whirlin' 'round the 
         house again, and January is full force!  January, 
         that's the month that everybody has to pay the 
         bills for the fun they had in December.  Also the 
         month that everybody breaks the New Year's resolu-tions they didn't intend to keep, anyway!

         Now that you've lent your ear, you can have it 
         back again.  I could tell you about a "chuck" be-ing a Shakespearean term meaning chicken, but I 
         won't.  That's because that mean A. Flood beat me 
         to it in that Katty Kolumn of her..    (Gerrrrrrr!)

         Well drown me in alcohol, and call me pickled, 
         if it isn't time to run along.  So, until next time 
         I'll say in Spanish  (???)  "hasty lumbago" which 
         means, goo-by, and I do mean goo!    Frank Faires

      <h3>HOW MANGE AGES...</h3>
      
      
      <p class="byline">Joan Kinsel</p>

         If one could imagine himself as standing on a 
         lofty peak from which he could witness the 
         panorama of life through the ages spread out 
         before him how struggling, how foolish our 
         twentieth century existence would seem!  How 
         unimportant the mere four or five thousand years 
         of our civilization would be!  For the vastness of 
         time is almost beyond human comprehension.  No one 
         as yet can accurately tell how long our earth, our 
         universe, and the seemingly limitless regions of 
         the heavens beyond have existed.  Henrik Van Loon 
         illustrated the immensity of time in this story: 
         "Picture a rock a hundred miles high and a hundred 
         miles wide.  To this rock a little bird comes 
         every thousand years to sharpen his beak.  When 
         the rock is completely worn away one day of 
         eternity will have passed."

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Somewhere 'way back in that dark abyss of time 
         our planet was crested and the stage was set for 
         life to begin, for the slow ascent of man.  We are 
         thus far on our journey and we do not know why we 
         are here or where we are going.  We are endowed 
         with a world of great beauty and tremendous 
         capabilities.  Often it looks as if we are at a 
         stand-still or sliding back a little for we 
         brutally murder our fellow men at too short 
         intervals and spend a great part of our energies 
         devising more efficient or larger scale methods of 
         warfare.  Look back for a moment and see how little 
         in the chronicles of Father Time, yet how much 
         from our own vantage point, we have progressed.

         The Darwinian theory traces the development of 
         man from the simplest forms of life (like jelly-fish) to his present state.  It is only a theory, 
         there is no proof; what remains is that man was a 
         special creation with a soul and the ability to 
         use his brain.  In this way he was very different 
         from all other living things and that is why we 
         study human history instead of the history of cats 
         or dogs.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The common conception of prehistoric man is 
         some long-armed, bent-kneed, gorilla-like creature 
         racing through the forest dragging his wife behind 
         him by her hair just letting her bump along if she 
         can't keep up.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Such an impression is greatly exaggerated.  We 
         know practically nothing about early man and his 
         origin but from discoveries of bones buried in 
         ancient soils, rude stone weapons, and pictures on 
         the walls of long forgotten caves, scientists have 
         pieced together a pictures of man's early existence.

         According to our present standards the first 
         man was far from handsome, although he probably 
         didn't think so.  He was considerably shorter 
         than we; he had a massive protruding jaw, a 
         sloping forehead, and a monkey-like face.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Early man didn't have to worry about income tax 
         or getting the car fixed but he was constantly 
         running for his very life with some angry mammoth 
         or a pack of wild boars hot on his heels.

         Food was the prime objective in life and he 
         spent most of his day prowling for something to 
         eat.  However, food was hard to obtain and not 
         very appetizing when one did get it.  The menu for 
         today might have included raw leaves, the roots of 
         plants, raw eggs, or, if hunting had been favorable 
         perhaps a wild bird or a small rabbit.  Nothing 
         was cooked of course for primitive man had not 
         seen fire except maybe from a volcano and if he 
         did see a volcano he more than likely didn't waste 
         <a href="1946/1946_43.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_43.jpg</img></a>
         
         
         any time finding a place to hide from it.  He tore 
         at his food with his teeth like an animal, but 
         people were not particular about manners in those 
         days, the main thing was to eat.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         He didn't worry about clothes, but suffered 
         the intense cold of winter and the blazing heat of 
         summer as best he could.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         The day held terrors but when evening came, man 
         huddled fearfully in some cave or hollow tree. 
         The danger of the fierce animals of the night was 
         no trivial matter and the law was "Eat or be 
         eaten."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Life was full of fear and misery and yet man 
         has survived hunger, cold, disease, and the slow 
         ascent goes on.

         "How many ages in time, no one knows the 
         rhyme."  So goes an old nursery song..  The drama 
         of life will continue on into the ages to come 
         with man struggling onward to some final goal.

         Gail glanced up to see Ron's smiling face.  So 
         many thoughts sprang to her mind.  Thoughts that 
         went way back to his football days at school.  He 
         had been so proud because he had been the star 
         player on his team.  After he had graduated, he had 
         decided to join the Navy.  Then he had been sent 
         across and after three years he had come home 
         again.

         It had been a long day, the day Ron came home. 
         Everyone tried to do and say the right things.  It 
         was hard to know what to say for Ron had come home 
         blind.  Gail had marvelled [marveled]
          at the way he had kept 
         his chin up and smiled all the time.  But now she 
         knew that he felt miserable inside.  She had found 
         out just yesterday.  Ron had been sitting in the 
         living room.  The radio had been on and the 
         announcer was telling about a star football 
         player and the games he was playing in.  Ron 
         suddenly jumped up, turned off the radio and made 
         his way the best he could from the room.

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Gail glanced at Ron again.  He was smiling as 
         he listened to the comedy play on the radio.  "Oh 
         why can't he be made to see?"  She shut her eyes 
         and kept repeating to herself, "Please make him 
         see again, please."  Gail couldn't sit and watch 
         him any longer so she went up to bed.
         </p>
      <a href="1946/1946_48.jpg"><img src="">1946/1946_48.jpg</img></a>
      
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Sleep slowly overtook her and she fell asleep 
         to dream.  She heard music, sweet bell-like music. 
         It came from the stars in the sky.  The music 
         became louder and Ron appeared.  He was in his 
         football suit and carried his football in his hand. 
         A bright star shone on his face and she could see 
         that he could see again.  A voice softly said, "He 
         shall see."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         "He can see, he can see," she cried.  Then 
         suddenly she awoke.  She could hear her mother 
         saying, "My son, oh my son."
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         She jumped out of bed and hurried down stairs. 
         Ron was smiling.  His eyes were half opened.  He 
         didn't say anything but just stood there smiling. 
         Then she remembered what the doctor had said. 
         They were to call him right away if anything 
         happened.  She knew her mother was much too happy 
         to remember to do it, so she walked quietly to the 
         phone and called him.
         </p>
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Both Ron and her mother were standing there in 
         a daze when Dr. Green came.  When Ron saw the 
         doctor, he became filled with silence as the 
         doctor analyzed the case.  He looked up.  "It's 
         amazing, the object has moved to such a position 
         that we can safely operate."
         </p>
      
      
      <p>
         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
         Gail and her mother sat in the waiting room. 
         Neither had much to say to each 
         other.  Soon the doctor came out. 
         His eyes were filled with won-derment.  He did not speak by 
         they knew by the light in his eyes 
         and the way he smiled, that it 
         had been a success.
         </p>

      <h3>Notes</h3>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 1:</b> Willa Cather was born December 7, 1873 in Virginia; however, she and her family moved
         to Nebraska in 1883. Cather graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in 1895
         and, during her long writing career, became well-known for her writings about pioneering
         Nebraska (Ahearn).</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 2:</b> In 1905, Nebraska "outlawed the sale, manufacture, or distribution of cigarettes
         and cigarette papers" ("Anti-smoking Law of 1905"). This law did not restrict the
         actual smoking of cigarettes and said nothing about pipe tobacco or cigars (a more
         "socially acceptable" option). Thus smokers still found ways to acquire cigarettes.
         However, in 1919, the ban was repealed and replaced with "two new cigarette laws,
         'Smoking cigarettes in public eating places, penalty' and 'Advertising cigarettes,
         penalty'" ("Anti-smoking Law of 1905). Again, only prohibiting cigarette smoking,
         and not tobacco use in general. However, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln prohibited
         smoking on campus, regardless of the form as early as 1907 ("Smokers on the Campus").
         So this commentary on boys who smoke discusses an idea that is generally permitted,
         though technically not allowed at their school, which was located on the University
         of Nebraska-Lincoln's campus.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 3:</b> Youth Week was sponsored by the United Christian Youth Movement, as noted in the
         author's text. The United Christian Youth Movement of North America began in 1934
         (Leffler &amp; Bond). According to a 1948 newspaper, it was under the supervision of the
         International Council of Religious Education (Venable). The United Christian Youth
         Movement sponsored many conferences for youth that sought to correct perceived societal
         ills such as race tension and poor leadership capabilities (Leffler &amp; Bond). By 1952,
         the movement had switched organizational supervision to the National Council of Churches
         (Jameson).</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 4:</b> The "jitterbug" dance originated in the United States and became popular in the 1930s
         and 1940s. Its movements are "energetic, acrobatic, and improvisational" and can be
         "performed with a partner, solo, or in a line" (Stein). Its name comes from the "jerky
         movements" of dancers during the Prohibition who drank too much alcohol. This type
         of dance is most often performed with jazz and swing music that has 4/4 time, though
         other upbeat music such as rock'n'roll can work (Stein).</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 5:</b> This essay, as with many essays in this text, should be read with context. The student
         who wrote this work moved to Nebraska from a southern state which likely still had
         Jim Crow laws. As such, their previous experience with race vastly differed from their
         observations of racial interactions in Nebraska. Although these observations likely
         were not cohesive across every black/white interaction, it does bring to light that
         racial prejudice was slowly changing. Readers should notice that, despite comments
         that seem derogatory, this student's expression of ideas are fairly radical for their
         time.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 6:</b> The Nebraska state "Home for Dependent Children" was originally established as the
         "Home for the Friendless" in 1881 and "took in destitute children and elderly women"
         (Nelson). Though established by the state legislature, it was a private organization
         until 1897 when it was taken over by the state (Nelson). Children who were "abandoned,
         neglected, or committed by the court" were "placed by the Home with adoptive or foster
         families" ("Youngest and...").The home regularly placed 100 or more children each
         year and housed between 200 and 300 children ("Youngest and..."). In 1906, the Nebraska
         Orthopedic Hospital took over one floor of the home. In 1909, the name changed to
         the "State Public School" and in 1911 to "Home for Dependent Children." With this
         final name change, the home was temporarily moved from the southeast corner of South
         and 11st Streets in Lincoln, NE to 944 H Street because the hospital took over the
         entire building. The home moved again in 1914 to 1425 F Street (Nelson). By 1946,
         it is evident that the home had moved again, this time to the address the author notes:
         5903 Walker Avenue.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 7:</b> Jazz is a type of music that relies heavily on improvisation. Although there is much
         variety in jazz, it tends to be rhythmic and include "swing" forward momentum. Jazz
         music often has call and repeat type sounds where one instrument might respond to
         another instrument's notes. Because of the personal nature of jazz, it is often emotion-filled
         and unique to the artist ("What is Jazz?").</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 8:</b> The author of this essay mixed up the Roman and Greek gods. The student likely learned
         about both of these civilizations around the same time in class. Since the Roman culture
         appropriated many of the Greek customs, including their dieties, the student likely
         misremembered which diety names were the Greek version and which were the Roman version.
         As such, they put the Roman names in their essay. The corrected Greek version are
         noted.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 9:</b> This work is a parody of William Shakespeare's <em>Macbeth</em>. <em>Macbeth</em> is one of Shakespeare's shorter tragedies and was likely written between 1599 and
         1606. The play is originally set in Scotland and follows Scottish general Macbeth
         as he hungers for political power. Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth both spiral downward
         as they encounter the consequences of greed ("Macbeth by William Shakespeare"). The
         author of this parody likely read the play in class, and then chose to create an alternate
         version of the text, sometimes staying close to the original and sometimes drifting
         away.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 10:</b> "Aide de camp" means "a subordinate military or naval officer acting as a confidential
         assistant to a superior, usually to a general officer or admiral" ("aide-de-camp").
         In the context of this text, the author is likely insinuating that she feels like
         her mother's subordinate who is forced to help in the kitchen, even though she'd rather
         not.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 11:</b> Although "gay" started showing up in written psychological works in the 1940s, it
         wasn't until the 1970s that the word become a more common term for "a (usually male)
         homosexual" ("gay (adj.)"). Before it became more common to discuss sexual orientation
         in the 1970s, "gay" described a person who was "full of joy, merry; light-hearted,
         carefree" or someone who was "wanton, lewd, lascivious" ("gay (adj.)"). For this text,
         the meaning is likely the first archaic definition, describing a joyous or carefree
         feeling. For more information on the etymology of the term "gay," visit www.etymonline.com/word/gay</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 12:</b> Although the author states that their quote is from a nursery rhyme, the quote is
         actually from a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem entitled "There was a little girl."
         To read the entire short poem, visit www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44650/there-was-a-little-girl.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 13:</b> In this text, "Salerno" likely refers to the Allied invasion of Italy in September
         1943 during World War II. The invasion did not end well. The US army tried to time
         the invasion with the Italian surrender, but it did not go according to plan. The
         Germans quickly took control of Italy when the surrender occurred, and thus the US
         troops met heavy fire as they came onshore. The resulting battle was horrible. After
         three days, it seeme the US army was finished, but they (with help from the British)
         brough in technological weapons and and eventually the German army was defeated. However,
         this was not without heavy causalties on both sides (Citino). To read a more day-by-day
         narrative of the battle, visit www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/75-years-ago-us-invasion-italy.
         </p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 14:</b> In the military, "K. P." means "Kitchen Police" or "Kitchen Patrol." This duty is
         often assigned to lower-ranking personnel ("KP duty"). In the context of this "joke,"
         the racial tension between the seemingly uneducated "colored" soldiers and the implied
         white sergeant shows just how this "lower-ranking personnel" might have been chosen
         for K. P. duty.</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 15:</b> "A. Flood" likely refers to the author's classmate Audrey Flood, who wrote "The History
         of Algebra."</p>
      
      <p class="editorial"><b>Note 16:</b> Although the author states that their quote is from a nursery rhyme, the quote is
         actually from a Christina Rossetti poem entitled "How Many Seconds?" To read the entire
         poem, visit quillsliteracy.org/how-many-seconds-by-christina-rossetti-1684/.</p>
